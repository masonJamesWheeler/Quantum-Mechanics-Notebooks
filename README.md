## Introduction

Welcome to the Quantum Mechanics Class repository! This course aims to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics, quantum phenomena, quantum interpretations, and the application of these concepts to computing.

This repository hosts all the homework notebooks associated with the course, demonstrating deep comprehension of various topics within quantum mechanics, and applications of these theories using Python for quantum computations.

## Course Structure

The course is broken down into the following modules:

1. Schrödinger Equation
2. Quantum Phenomena
3. Quantum States (Cats and Qubits)
4. Quantum Interpretations
5. Quantum Logic and Grover's Algorithm

Each module introduces fundamental principles and theories of quantum mechanics and quantum computing and is paired with a comprehensive homework assignment to reinforce the learning and provide hands-on experience in problem-solving and programming for quantum systems.

## Repository Structure

The repository structure is as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── HW1_schrodinger_equation.ipynb
├── HW2_quantum_phenomena.ipynb
├── HW3_cats_and_qubits.ipynb
├── HW4_quantum_interpretations.ipynb
└── HW5_logic_and_grover.ipynb
```

Each `HW<i>_*.ipynb` file is a Jupyter notebook containing the homework associated with the corresponding course module.

## Usage

These Jupyter notebooks can be run on platforms that support them, such as JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or Google Colab.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone <repository_link>
```
2. Navigate to the directory.
```bash
cd <directory_name>
```
3. Open the desired Jupyter notebook.
```bash
jupyter notebook HW<i>_*.ipynb
```

Remember to replace `<i>` and `*` with the specific homework number and topic you wish to review.
